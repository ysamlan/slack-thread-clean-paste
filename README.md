# Slack Thread Clean Paste

Simple tool built by Gemini 2.5 Pro to take the hot mess that is the result of copying a Slack message thread, and get you clean output either as Markdown or as formatted text suitable for pasting into a Google doc.

Tested on MacOS with the Slack app; YMMV in other OSes and clients.
